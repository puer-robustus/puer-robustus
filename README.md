# I'm Using GitHub Under Protest

I use GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret
system that is not Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). I am deeply
concerned about having to use a proprietary system like GitHub to
contribute to FOSS projects.

Alternative, fully FOSS code forges exist. For all my own projects, I
use [sourcehut][1]. If sourcehut is not for you, have a look at
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) instead.

I urge you to read about the [Give up
GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom
Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the
reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.
